1. _On Desktop,_ **to toggle the blur background;** on the site, when your mouse is on the 100vh of the landing area, the background is clear and when your mouse leaves the 100vh of the landing area of the site, the background is blurred.

2. _On Mobile,_ **to toggle the blur background;** on the site, when you tap on the top 60vh of the landing area, the background becomes _clear_ and if you clear anywhere below the 60vh, the background becomes _blur_
